<H4><A NAME = "rti"></A>Rayleigh-Taylor mixing 
</H4>
<P>This is work by Michael Gallis (magalli at sandia.gov) at Sandia.
</P>
<P>This calculation was done to model Rayleigh/Taylor mixing which occurs
when a heavy gas is on top of a light gas and gravity induces mixing
and turbulent effects.
</P>
<P>This is a large 3d calculation of He (red) on top of Ar (blue).  4.5B
particles were run with 400M grid cells for 240K timesteps.  The
simulation was run on 32K nodes (16 cores per node, 512K MPI tasks) of
the Sequoia BG/Q machine at Lawrence Livermore National Labs (LLNL).
</P>
<P>Snapshot images of the simulation were created using SPARTA's <A HREF = "doc/dump_image.html">dump
image</A> command, rather than saving particle data
to disk.  The first image is the final state of the simulation.  The
second image is a movie of the simulation.

<H4><A NAME = "rmi"></A>Richtmyer-Meshkov mixing 
</H4>
<P>This is work by Michael Gallis (magalli at sandia.gov) at Sandia.
</P>
<P>This calculation was done to model Richtmyer/Meshkov mixing which
occurs when a light gas is on top of a heavier gas and a shock induces
mixing and turbulent effects.
</P>
<P>This is a large 2d calculation of He (green) on top of Ar (red).  4.5B
particles were run with 400M grid cells for 240K timesteps.  The
simulation was run on 32K nodes (16 cores per node, 512K MPI tasks) of
the Sequoia BG/Q machine at Lawrence Livermore National Labs (LLNL).
</P>
<P>Snapshot images of the simulation were created using SPARTA's <A HREF = "doc/dump_image.html">dump
image</A> command, rather than saving particle data
to disk.  The first 2 images are the initial and final state of the
simulation.  The thrid image is a movie of the simulation.  The fourth
image is a comparison of the DSMC results to experiment and a
continuum Navier-Stokes simulation.

<H4><A NAME = "mir"></A>Flow around Mir space station 
</H4>
<P>This is work by Michael Gallis (magalli at sandia.gov) at Sandia,
using a surface mesh for the Mir space station provided by Jay LeBeau
(NASA).
</P>
<P>This calculation was done to model flow around Mir at an altitude of
300K feet.  1.6B particles were used (at steady state) with a
computational grid of 10M cells.  The Mir surface mesh has 53K
triangles.  The simulation ran for 0.5M timesteps on 128 nodes (2048
cores) of a large Intel Xeon cluster at Sandia.  The final
time-averaged steady-state grid and surface element data was written
to a file and visualized by <A HREF = "http://www.tecplot.com">TecPlot</A>.  The
grid cell coloring is for gas temperature; the surface element
coloring is for heatflux onto the surface.
</P>
<P>The first image is a single snapshot of a cut plane through the data
set.  The second image is a "movie" of scanning the cut plane through
the data set.  The third and fourth images are of similar data sets
rendered by the <A HREF = "http://www.paraview.org">ParaView visualization toolkit</A>.

<P>These are snapshots of the adapted grid used to model
flow around spacecraft.

<P>The first image is of the Apollo capsule, with flow coming from the
lower left.  The grid is adapted through 5 levels.  The second image
is of the Mir space station with a few levels of adaptation around the
leading edge of the surfaces directly impacted by the flow.

<H4><A NAME = "paraview"></A>ParaView viz of reentry flows 
</H4>
<P>These are snapshots from simulations done by Michael Gallis (magalli
at sandia.gov) to illlustrate use of the open-source <A HREF = "http://www.paraview.org">ParaView
visualization package</A> with SPARTA output.  Each is a simple
demonstration of flow around a spacecraft in the upper atomosphere,
e.g. as it undergoes re-entry.
</P>


<P>The workflow for running the simulations was as follows.
</P>
<P>a) Convert an STL file representing the object to a SPARTA surface
data file, readable by the <A HREF = "doc/read_surf.html">read_surf</A> command.
This conversion was done with the <A HREF = "doc/Section_tools.html#stl2surf">stl2surf
tool</A>.  The STL and sdata surface files
are in the data directory of the distribution.
</P>
<P>b) Run a SPARTA simulation which produces grid and surface element
output via the <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump grid</A> and <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump surf</A>
commands.
</P>
<P>c) Convert the output to ParaView format via the <A HREF = "doc/Section_tools.html#paraview">paraview
tools</A> Python scripts.
</P>
<P>d) Run <A HREF = "http://www.paraview.org">ParaView</A> to produce images like these or
animations.

space shuttle.
