Ways to use the SPARTA mail list :h4

Anyone can post messages to the list by sending an email to
sparta-users at lists.sourceforge.net. :ulb,l

Anyone can browse/search previous questions/answers "in the
archives"_sfarchive. :l

You do not have to subscribe to the list to post Qs, receive answers
(to your Qs), or browse/search the archives. :l

You do need to subscribe to the list if you want emails for all the
posts (per-message or in digest form), or to answer Qs yourself.  Feel
free to sign up and help us out! :l

You can subscribe/unsubscribe, change your subscriber options, ofview
the archives from the "SPARTA mail list home page"_sfmail. :l

If you post a message and you are a subscriber, your message will
appear immediately.  If you are not a subscriber, your message will be
moderated, which typically takes a day.  Either way, when someone
replies you will receive that reply as a personal email, and the reply
will appear on the list in the new thread your message started.
Posting a message sends email to subscribers immediately, but it can
take a few hours for postings and replies to show up in the
SourceForge archive. :l
