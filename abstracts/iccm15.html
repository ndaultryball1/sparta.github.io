<P>This paper describes the application of a Direct Simulation Monte
Carlo (DSMC) computational kernel, called SPARTA (Stochastic Parallel
Rarefied-gas Time-accurate Analyzer) <B>1</B> to the capture of shock waves
in rarefied hypersonic flows. Three cases are considered: a hypersonic
flat plate simulation, a Mach 15.6 flow over a flared cylinder and a
Mach 20.2 flow over a 70-degree planetary probe. For all three cases a
comparison between experimental and numerical results is presented, to
assess the ability of the code to effectively and efficiently simulate
such demanding flows.
